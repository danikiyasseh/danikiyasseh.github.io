		The healthcare industry now generates troves of data from distinct modalities on a daily basis. Such data modalities range from the micro of genomics, which capture information at the sub-cellular level, 
    to the macro of physiological signals and medical images, which capture information at the organ level. Extracting clinically-meaningful insight from such data can be achieved via deep learning algorithms, which
    are notoriously data-hungry (read: require abundant labelled data). Oftentimes, however, the rate with which this data are generated far exceeds the rate with which 
    they can be realistically annotated by medical professionals. For example, in low-resource clinical settings, medical professionals may lack the necessary expertise or simply be unavailable to provide annotations. 
    Conversely, in high-resource clinical settings, medical professionals are inundated by the sheer number of requests for annotations, exacerbating the increasingly-observed phenomenon of physician-burnout. As such, 
    clinical settings are now commonly characterized by the presence of limited labelled data and abundant unlabelled data. One way to deal with this scenario is through active learning, as outlined next.

    <h4>
    Introduction to Active Learning
    </h4>
    <p>
    An active learning framework allows neural networks to achieve strong performance while simultaneously exploiting a labelled and unlabelled set of data and minimizing the annotation burden placed on an oracle 
    (e.g., a physician). All such frameworks typically iterate over four main steps: 1) <i> train </i> - a neural network is trained on some existing labelled data, 2) <i> acquire </i> - the same network is tasked with 
    acquiring unlabelled data points, 3) <i> label </i> - an oracle (e.g., physician) is tasked with labelling such acquired data points, and 4) <i> augment </i> - the neural network is trained on the existing and 
    newly-labelled data points. Whereas previous work in the literature commonly focuses on either step 2 (acquisition) or step 3 (annotation), we modify both.

    Limitations of Existing Methods to Active Learning
    </h4>
    <h5>
    How do current methods acquire unlabelled datapoints?
    </h5>
    <p>
    To acquire datapoints from a pool of unlabelled data, active learning methods rank these datapoints from most informative to least informative. This ranking system, which reflects the informativeness of a datapoints, 
    is known as an acquisition function and is usually user-defined. One favourable acquisition function is Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD), which

    <h5>
    How do current methods annotate newly-acquired unlabelled datapoints?
    </h5>    
    <p>
    Current methods typically assume the presence of an ideal oracle (e.g., physician) who is capable of providing correct annotations for any and all of the acquired unlabelled datapoints. This assumption, however, is unlikely to hold 
    within healthcare where physicians can either lack expertise for a particular task (generating incorrect annotations) or simply be unavailable (not providing annotations at all).
